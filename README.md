# Livedaze
A Time management web application built with React, Redux, and Firebase
## Motivation
As a part of my 2019 new year resolution, I wanted to learn and use React to build my pet project. I was fascinated by the idea of Virtual DOM and its ecosystem. I started learning some basic syntax and mechanisms from React official website and jump straight to develop and learn more in-depth contents by actually using React.
I tried my best not to use anything else but React. However, as state management getting complicated, and hearing things about how Redux is excellent with React, I soon integrated Redux to the project. The project is currently deployed at https://livedaze.com, and most of the basic functionalities are available. Although there are still many problems and issues to fix/update, I am quite satisfied with the current progress that I have made over time.
